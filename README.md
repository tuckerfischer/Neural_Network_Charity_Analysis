# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

In this project we were tasked with building a neural network in order to determine if an applicant for a charity fund will be successful if funded.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

Before doing the analysis we removed the companies name and identifier. The features we took in to consideration were:

  1. Application Type
  2. Affiliated secor or industry
  3. government organization classification
  4. Use case for funding
  5. Organization type
  6. Active status
  7. Income classification
  8. Special considerations for application
  9. Funding amount requested

The target of this analysis was whether not not the money was used effectively.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
